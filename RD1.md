Objective and Procedure:

The objective of this program was to enhance skills in dictionary usage, problem-solving, function creation, and file I/O operations. By working with Morse code translation, the task required understanding how to map data (letters to Morse code) using dictionaries, a fundamental data structure. Additionally, the assignment required applying problem-solving techniques to decompose the problem into smaller functions, such as reading input files, converting Morse code to English, and writing the output back to a file. This was intended to teach modular programming and efficient function design. A crucial part of the task was handling file input and output operations, including error checking for missing files and ensuring proper formatting during reading and writing. By completing this program, we were expected to practice creating a well-structured and functional program while following systematic problem-solving steps.

The approach to solving the problem involved identifying key steps: error-checking user input, reading the Morse code dictionary file, converting Morse code files into readable text, and writing the results to an output file. To achieve this, a dictionary was used to map Morse code to English letters, which allowed for quick and accurate translations. Functions were created for file validation, dictionary parsing, file conversion, and output handling. Key concepts such as accessing dictionary values, handling whitespace in file parsing, and managing I/O errors were explored. Modularization and the use of descriptive comments above each function further ensured clarity and reusability of the code. By following these steps, we were able to create a program that dynamically reads Morse code input files and translates them into plain text outputs, demonstrating an understanding of the lab's objectives.

Results and Reflection:

The results matched expectations to an extent, though the process was challenging. The program successfully converted Morse code files into plain text when valid files were provided, producing readable outputs. While no extreme test cases were used, standard cases worked as intended. The most significant challenge was creating the Morse code conversion function. This involved ensuring proper spacing between words and letters and validating all possible inputs against the Morse code dictionary. Debugging this part of the program required patience and a step-by-step approach. Following the first three rules of programming—keeping it simple, being modular, and testing thoroughly—was critical to overcoming these difficulties. Key takeaways from this assignment include the importance of error checking, breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, and using dictionaries for efficient data mapping. Although the program's development was challenging, it reinforced the skills needed for effective programming. Regarding teamwork, it was disappointing as my partner did not contribute much to the project, which made the workload heavier. However, completing the assignment independently provided valuable hands-on experience.
